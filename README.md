# React switch to Style

This extension adds a keybinding to switch between Styles using the CSS Modules pattern and their corresponding React components.

## How it works?

Style files should have one of the style suffixes below and be in same folder as the code file.

`.css`, `.styl`, `.scss`, `.scss`, or `.less`

React files should have one of these suffixes:

`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`


### Example:

Code file: `src/components/Dialog/Alert.jsx`

Style file: `src/components/Dialog/Alert.scss`

## How to use?

Note: Keep the `cmd`/`ctrl` key held down, then press `k` followed by `.`

Mac OS: `cmd+k cmd+.`

Windows: `ctrl+k ctrl+.`
